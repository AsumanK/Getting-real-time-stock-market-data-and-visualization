# Getting-real-time-stock-market-data-and-visualization

This project aims to introduce how to get real time stock market data using Yahoo finance API yahoo_fin and visualize it as candle chart using cufflinks.
The stock market prices to be investigated are RR.L (Rolls-Royce holdings), SVT.L (Severn Trent plc), BATS.L (British American Tobbaco), SGC.L (Stagecoach Group plc), LLOY.L (Lloyds Banking Group plc), AND NG.L (National Grid plc).
We will apply bollinger bands and macd technical analysis tools.


# Bollinger bands 
Are a type of chart indicator for technical analysis used to determine entry and exit points for a trade, often used to determine overbought and oversold conditions, using only bands to trade is a risky strategy since the indicator focuses on price and volatility, while ignoring a lot of other information.

# MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
A trend following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security price. It is calculated by subtracting the 26-period exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA. It triggers technical signals when it crosses above (to buy) or below (to sell) its signal line. The speed crossover is also taken as a signal of a market is overbought or oversold. Overall, it helps investors understand whether the bullish or bearish movement in the price is strengthening or weakening.
